# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# Example environment configuration for the React frontend.
# Copy to ".env" and adjust values as needed.
#
# This value must include the full protocol and host (HTTPS strongly recommended in browsers).
# The default points to the running backend container exposed in this workspace.
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://vscode-internal-38494-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3001

# Notes:
# - For local development, you can set this to http://localhost:3001 if your backend is running locally.
# - Ensure your backend CORS settings allow this frontend origin.
# - After changing this file, restart the dev server so CRA picks up new env vars.
